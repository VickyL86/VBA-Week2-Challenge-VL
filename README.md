# Week2-Challenge-VBA
Week 2 Project Repository 

Dear Supreme Central Grader, 

The attached documentation includes a VBA script intended to create a slightly 'overengineered' pivot table. The table provides a summary of values for stock prices. 
The script can be ran for multiple worksheets in a single XLSM file - provided that data in each sheet is saved in the same columns A-G. 

While not the most elegant, I am hoping that the VBS script attached doesn't radiate the anguish this assignment put me through. After running the script 
on the target data I was worried that my laptop will self-distruct. Thankfully, it lived to tell the tale, and allowed me to provide you with these stunning 
selfies.  

Notable mentions:
The script was created with codes obtained from the VBS Scripting week presenations, Stack Overflow, my own musings on the subject, and - most notably - 
through tutoring sessions with our TA Dwight and his lovely, although demanding cat, Mr. Murderbritches. Mr Murderbritches 
was featured prominently throughout my work to emphasize his contributions to the project. Above else, I wanted to also thank my boyfriend Marlon
for his patience and quality of snacks provided during development of this project. 

Best Regards, 

Vicky
